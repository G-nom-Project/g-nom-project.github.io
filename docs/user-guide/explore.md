You can explore data managed by G-nom through different category pages.

1. The assemblies list (`/assemblies`) allows you to scroll and search all assemblies stored on G-nom servers represented by [assembly cards](./assembly-card.md)
2. For each assembly, the [assembly page](./assembly-page.md) (`/assembly/{id}`) provides dashboards for imported analyses and links other relevant resources
3. Bookmarked assemblies can be found on your dashboard (`/bookmarks`)
4. Genome assemblies, mappings and annotations can be explored in the [genome browser](./browser.md) (`/browser`) bundled with G-nom
