Most of G-nom's functionality is tied to personal user accounts. You can create a new user account using your name and e-mail address at the URL `/register`.

!!! note "Self-signup"

    Admins can disable self-signup at their discretion. In this case contact your administrator to create an account manually for you.

If e-mail notifications are set up, you may receive an email to verify your mail address.
